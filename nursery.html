    <h2>09/18/25 – Living intentionally and such</h2>
    <p>I've been thinking a lot about living intentionally. I think I was made to cook, go to the gym, do chores, and work. If I'm missing any one of those I start to feel sad!</p>
    <p>I think a lot about living a romanticized "ghibli-ified" life. Folding laundry slowly, watching the sunlight filter through the window, taking time to write down my thoughts. Sometimes I wonder how feasible and reasonable it is to constantly savour every small moment. </p>
